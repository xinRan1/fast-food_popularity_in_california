# fast-food_popularity_in_california---data-scrapers

These py files are used to scrape data from API and web pages.
API: Yelp Fusion API, California Covid-19 Updates
web pages: Yelp businesses' pages, LA Dailys News posts 

By running the main.py, users can get the four datasets stored in csv files. 
There are three modes in the main script: remote is to get full versions of all four datasets; 
grade is to get short versions of four datasets; local is to get datasets from the disk. 

Before codes' excecution, users need to get a personal key from Yelp Fusion API, and fill the key in Yelp_Fusion_API_crawler.py
